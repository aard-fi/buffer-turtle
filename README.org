** Introduction

Ever since I've played with ChatGPT for the first time I've been wondering how it'd behave if it had the ability to control simple [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics][Turtle graphics]] in ASCII mode. While hooking various Emacs functionality up to [[https://github.com/karthink/gptel][gptel tools]] I realised that I now have an environment where it'd be able to draw just that.

This is a quick and dirty implementation of a turtle capable of going in four directions in any buffer - destroying the buffer contents as it goes. It can be run in two modes:

- Timer. It executes the current instruction roughly once per second. I initially had decent success in that mode - there's a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HQMoVXbET4][youtube video of my second test run]]. In new, clean sessions using that mode was a bit trickier: It seems it only works well after a good initial explanation of the turtle mechanics in the current context.
- Manual. The turtle can be called for each supported direction, and will draw exactly one step. I've implemented that mode after GPT tried to use the tool like that.

gptel bindings are provided for both modes - but you'd only want to have one set loaded to avoid confusion.

Loading the tool bindings is easiest done via the [[https://github.com/aard-fi/gptel-tool-library][gptel-tool library]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/gptel-tool-library")
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/buffer-turtle")
  (require 'gptel-tool-library)
  (dolist (module '("buffer" "buffer-turtle"))
    (gptel-tool-library-load-module module)))
#+END_SRC
